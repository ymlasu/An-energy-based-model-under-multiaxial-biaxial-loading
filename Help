The four codes are the essential to predict fatigue life.

The main code "FatiguePipeline.m" in the main folder is a sample. The following statement can help scholars to use this code to do predictions easily.

The first step is add the path to include rest of files to ensure the code can run correctly.
Secondly, import the material properties and fitting parameters which can be gathered from experimental data.
Thirdly, import the loading path data 
After these process, run the code can acquire the result from the parameter: "F_life".

Note:
The material properties and loading datas have been included in each material folder. The sample code show the structure how to reproduce the process.
If the material is not list in our file, importing the each property of material and loading data can predict the fatigue life. 
The proposed model have been validated by several materials.
